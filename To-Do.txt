To-Do:

1. Automate cronlist insertion
2. enable behavior choices (will adapt prompts) (based on questions AI will ask user optionally).
3. create interface that allows for insertion of config info
4. extend interface for options such as how many tweets per day, etc etc.
5. add in readme explanation how to get the required API keys
6. move together AI choice etc. in config to enable easy adjustments
7. fix rate limit checks (set own daily limits?)
8. improve internal prompts + bring them to external .txt with adjustable profile, tone etc preferences
